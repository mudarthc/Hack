# Hack
 I used the microsoft azure speech to text API to connect to my web app. Once the person speaks in the mic the data is linked to the web and I used javascript to parse the string. If the person says “Title” the next words are formatted as a title, if “Point” is said the word is formatted as a point. The output is shown on a separate linked webpage.
